# RFC Documents

This is a repository for creating RFC (Request for comment) documents to capture the scope of work for a new feature/updates to an existing feature.

This document should be authored to bring visibility into the problem statement, design details, decisions taken and various edge cases.

A sample template has been added to get this repository started, but it is expected to be updated over a period of time as the review process gets streamlined.
